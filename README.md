### Explanation of Key Folders:
- **app/**: The new App Router directory contains all pages, APIs, and route groups. Key sections include `api` for API endpoints, `(auth)` for authentication pages, and `(dashboard)` for the main dashboard and related features.
- **components/**: Houses reusable UI components organized by purpose (e.g., `dashboard`, `camera`, `notifications`), promoting easy reuse across features.
- **features/**: Modular feature-first design; each feature (like `camera`, `notifications`, `reports`) is self-contained with its specific hooks, components, and utilities.
- **store/**: State management to keep global state organized and accessible, especially for complex or cross-feature state handling.
- **services/**: External API integrations like WhatsApp or email notifications are managed here to centralize third-party dependencies.
- **utils/**: Common utilities like date formatting, validation, and constants are centralized here to avoid redundancy.


## Feature Development

To ensure a solid foundation and address critical functionality, I recommend prioritizing the following features in this order:

### 1. **[~] User Management & Role Control**
   - **Reason**: Role-based access is crucial for security, allowing specific access levels from the start. Establishing this feature first also simplifies the development of all other components, ensuring that each user's permissions dictate their interactions across the platform.
   - **Core Elements**: Basic roles (Admin, Manager, Viewer), user authentication, and session management.

### 2. **[ ]Camera Feed Integration & Management**
   - **Reason**: Integrating camera feeds early provides the backbone for core functionality like real-time monitoring and video analysis, which subsequent features will depend on.
   - **Core Elements**: Adding cameras, assigning them to locations, basic health checks, and ensuring live feed connectivity. Once established, it will facilitate real-time alerts and visualizations.

### 3. **[ ]Real-Time Alerts & Notifications**
   - **Reason**: Real-time notifications for incidents (e.g., missing safety gear) are essential for immediate corrective action. Implementing this early helps refine integration with camera feeds and establishes the notification system, paving the way for alert customization and linking to video footage.
   - **Core Elements**: Basic notification triggers, linking alerts to corresponding video timestamps, and integration with web notifications (WhatsApp/email can be added as an enhancement).

### 4. **[ ]Interactive Dashboard & Data Visualization**
   - **Reason**: A centralized view with real-time data helps users see the status at a glance and provides insights from camera feeds and alerts. This feature should follow once camera feeds and alerts are in place, as it will rely on data from both.
   - **Core Elements**: Real-time dashboard with key metrics, camera health overview, and basic visualizations like charts or graphs showing alert trends.

### 5. **[ ]Custom Report Generation**
   - **Reason**: Reports support compliance and auditing, which are essential for industries that require historical tracking. Building this feature once live data and notifications are functional ensures you can provide meaningful, actionable reports from real usage.
   - **Core Elements**: Basic shift-based, daily, and weekly reports with PDF and Excel export options.

### 6. **[ ]Issue Ticketing System**
   - **Reason**: The ticketing system enables issue tracking, essential for keeping track of violations or system issues. Having historical alerts and the user management system in place first allows tickets to be assigned to relevant users.
   - **Core Elements**: Basic ticket creation for violations, status tracking, and notifications for updates.

### 7. **[ ]User-Friendly UI/UX**
   - **Reason**: Designing a user-friendly interface is crucial for ensuring ease of use, particularly for non-technical users. However, implementing core backend and role features first gives context to the UI/UX requirements.
   - **Core Elements**: Begin with a responsive and clean dashboard, with scalability in mind for more complex, future enhancements.

### 8. **[ ]Additional Must-Have Features**
   - **Reason**: These features, like audit logs, video storage management, and multi-tenant capabilities, add value for long-term scalability and advanced use cases. Implement them after the core functionality is working smoothly.
   - **Core Elements**: Add these incrementally to enhance reliability, multi-organizational use, and compliance features.

This approach ensures a structured and layered development where foundational security, live monitoring, and alerting are in place before layering in user-friendly interfaces, detailed reporting, and advanced customization. Each feature builds on the previous, ensuring that the final product is secure, functional, and scalable.
